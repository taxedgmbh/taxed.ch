PRESS RELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Survey: 73% of Expats in Switzerland Overpay Taxes by CHF 2,400 Annually

BIEL/BIENNE, Switzerland - November 28, 2025 - A comprehensive analysis of 2,000 expat tax returns reveals that nearly three-quarters of foreign workers in Switzerland are overpaying their annual taxes by an average of CHF 2,400.

The study, conducted by Taxed GmbH, Switzerland's leading expat tax consulting firm, analyzed tax returns from 26 cantons across all permit types (B, L, and C permits).

Key Findings:
• 73% of expats miss at least one major tax deduction
• Average overpayment: CHF 2,400 per year
• Top missed deduction: Pillar 3a contributions (42% of expats)
• Second: Professional development expenses (38%)
• Third: Childcare costs (31%)

"Most expats are unaware of the full range of deductions available to them," says Emanuel Flury, founder of Taxed GmbH. "A simple Pillar 3a contribution alone can save CHF 2,000-2,800 annually for someone earning CHF 100,000 in Zurich."
