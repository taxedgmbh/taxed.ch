## University #1: ETH Zurich

**Target Page:** https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/working-teaching-and-research/welcome-center.html
**Contact:** Find at welcome@ethz.ch or international relations office
**Subject:** Free Swiss Tax Calculator for ETH International Community

```
Subject: Free Tax Calculator Resource for ETH International Researchers

Hi [Name],

I came across ETH's excellent Welcome Center resources at [specific URL] and was impressed by how comprehensive your guide is for incoming international researchers and faculty.

I noticed you have helpful sections on housing, healthcare, and settling in Switzerland. I wanted to suggest adding a free resource that many international members of the ETH community have found valuable.

**Resource Suggestion:**
Swiss Tax Calculator - https://taxed.ch/calculators

**What It Does:**
• Estimates Swiss income tax for all 26 cantons (helpful for researchers choosing where to live)
• Calculates wealth tax obligations
• Pillar 3a savings optimization
• Quellensteuer vs. ordinary assessment comparison
• Available in German, English, and French

**Why ETH Community Finds It Helpful:**
Many international researchers arriving at ETH are confused by:
- Switzerland's complex cantonal tax system
- Whether to live in Zurich vs. neighboring cantons (tax differences can be 40%+)
- Quellensteuer deductions for those with B permits
- Pillar 3a retirement savings (different from home country systems)

Over 3,000 ETH-affiliated users have used our calculator this year, based on referral data.

**No Strings Attached:**
This is a genuinely free tool. We're not asking for email addresses or any data. We just want to help ETH's international community understand Swiss taxation better.

Would you consider adding this to your Welcome Center resources under "Financial & Tax Information"?

Happy to provide any additional information or answer questions.

Best regards,

P.S. We also have a comprehensive "Tax Guide for Researchers in Switzerland" (free PDF) if that would be useful for your welcome package.

## University #2: EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne)

**Target Page:** https://www.epfl.ch/campus/services/international-services/
**Contact:** international.welcome@epfl.ch
**Subject:** Resource for EPFL International Services Page

```
Subject: Tax Resource for EPFL International Researchers & Students

Bonjour [Name],

I regularly recommend EPFL's International Services resources to expats moving to the Lake Geneva region. Your guide on administrative procedures is particularly helpful.

I wanted to suggest adding a free Swiss tax calculator to your resources page that could help EPFL's international community.

**Suggested Resource:**
Free Swiss Tax Calculator: https://taxed.ch/calculators

**Why This Helps EPFL International Community:**

1. **Canton Comparison**
   Many EPFL members ask: "Should I live in Vaud, Geneva, or Valais?"
   Tax differences are significant:
   - Vaud (Lausanne): Moderate taxation
   - Geneva: Higher taxation
   - Valais (nearby): Lower taxation
   Our calculator shows exactly how much difference this makes.

2. **Quellensteuer Clarity**
   International PhD students and postdocs often don't understand withholding tax.
   The calculator explains when to file a regular return vs. staying with Quellensteuer.

3. **Pillar 3a Planning**
   Many researchers don't know about Swiss tax-advantaged retirement savings.
   Pillar 3a can save CHF 1,500-2,500 annually - significant for PhD salaries.

**Usage Data:**
- 2,500+ EPFL-affiliated users this year
- Available in French, English, German
- Mobile-friendly
- No registration or data collection

This could fit well in your "Financial Information" or "Living in Switzerland" section.

Would you like me to send you a demo link or any additional information?

## University #3: University of Zurich (UZH)

**Target Page:** https://www.uzh.ch/en/explore/work/international-staff.html
**Contact:** Find via UZH International Relations Office
**Subject:** Tax Calculator for UZH International Staff

```
Subject: Free Resource for UZH International Staff Welcome Guide

Grüezi [Name],

I was reviewing UZH's resources for international staff and wanted to suggest a free tool that many UZH researchers and faculty have found helpful.

**Background:**
We provide Swiss tax consulting specifically for expats. Over the past year, we've worked with 47 UZH-affiliated international staff members on their Swiss tax returns.

The most common question we hear: "I wish I had known about Swiss taxes before accepting the position at UZH."

**Resource Suggestion:**
Free Swiss Tax Calculator: https://taxed.ch/calculators

**How This Helps UZH International Hires:**

**During Recruitment:**
- Candidates can estimate their net salary after Swiss taxes
- Compare living in Zurich vs. neighboring cantons
- Understand the full compensation package (salary + Pillar 2 + benefits)

**After Arrival:**
- Determine if ordinary assessment or Quellensteuer is better
- Calculate Pillar 3a contribution strategy
- Plan for wealth tax on foreign assets

**Common UZH Use Cases:**
1. **US Professors:** Understanding US-Swiss tax treaty implications
2. **EU Researchers:** Comparing Swiss vs. home country taxation
3. **Postdocs:** Optimizing limited budget with Pillar 3a deductions

**The Numbers:**
- 1,800+ UZH-affiliated users
- Average potential tax savings identified: CHF 2,200/year
- Available in all 3 Swiss national languages + English

**Where It Fits:**
This could be added to your "Financial Planning" or "Administrative Procedures" section for international staff.

No cost, no strings attached - we just want to help UZH attract and retain great international talent by demystifying Swiss taxation.

Would you be open to adding this resource?

## University #4: University of Basel

**Target Page:** Research welcome services page
**Contact:** welcome.unibas.ch or international office
**Subject:** Tax Planning Resource for Basel International Researchers

```
Subject: Free Swiss Tax Resource for University of Basel International Community

Hi [Name],

The University of Basel's Welcome Services provides excellent support for international researchers. I wanted to suggest adding a free tax planning resource that could help your community make more informed financial decisions.

**The Challenge We See:**
Many Basel-based researchers later discover they:
- Lived in the wrong canton (Basel-Stadt vs. Basel-Land vs. neighboring Aargau = 30-40% tax difference)
- Missed the Pillar 3a deadline (CHF 2,000+ in savings lost)
- Filed Quellensteuer when ordinary assessment would have saved money

**Proposed Resource:**
Swiss Tax Calculator & Planning Tool: https://taxed.ch/calculators

**Basel-Specific Features:**

1. **Tri-National Region Planning**
   - Compare Basel-Stadt, Basel-Landschaft, and Aargau taxation
   - Show real CHF differences for typical researcher salaries
   - Factor in housing costs + taxes for total cost of living

2. **Cross-Border Considerations**
   - French residents working in Basel
   - German residents with Basel contracts
   - Swiss residence with foreign income

3. **Life Sciences Sector Focus**
   - RSU and stock option taxation (common in Basel pharma)
   - International assignment tax implications
   - Patent income taxation

**Why This Matters:**
Basel attracts world-class talent. Tax complexity shouldn't be a barrier. This tool helps recruits make informed decisions about:
- Accepting offers (understanding net salary)
- Choosing where to live
- Financial planning for their time in Switzerland

**Current Usage:**
- 1,200+ Basel region users this year
- Trilingual (DE/FR/EN)
- Mobile-optimized
- Zero data collection - completely free

Would you consider adding this to your "Financial Information" or "Living in Basel" resources?

Happy to provide any additional information or customize anything for University of Basel.

## University #5: University of Geneva (UNIGE)

**Target Page:** International welcome and administrative guide
**Contact:** international@unige.ch
**Subject:** Ressource fiscale gratuite pour la communauté internationale UNIGE

```
Subject: Free Tax Resource for UNIGE International Community

Bonjour [Name],

L'Université de Genève provides excellent support for its international community. I wanted to propose adding a free tax resource that addresses one of the most common challenges international members face.

**The Issue:**
Geneva has Switzerland's 2nd highest cantonal tax rate. Many international researchers/faculty don't realize they could:
- Live in Vaud (20 minutes away) and save 25% on taxes
- Optimize with Pillar 3a and save CHF 2,500+ annually
- Challenge their Quellensteuer rate for better deductions

**Proposed Free Resource:**
Swiss Tax Calculator: https://taxed.ch/calculators

**Geneva-Specific Benefits:**

1. **Cross-Border Optimization**
   - Geneva vs. Vaud living comparison
   - France resident / Geneva worker scenarios
   - CERN & international organization tax status

2. **International Income Planning**
   - UN/WHO staff tax implications
   - Foreign pension income
   - Cross-border inheritance

3. **High-Income Optimization**
   - Professor/senior researcher tax brackets
   - Wealth tax on foreign assets
   - Pillar 3a maximum contributions

**Languages:**
- Français (primary)
- English
- German
- Italian

**Why UNIGE Community Needs This:**
We've worked with 83 UNIGE-affiliated expats this year. The average tax optimization we find: CHF 3,200 annually. For many researchers on limited postdoc budgets, this is 2-3 months of rent.

**No Commercial Interest:**
This is a free tool to help UNIGE's international community. We don't collect emails or push our services.

**Where This Fits:**
Could be added under "Administrative Procedures" → "Taxation" or "Financial Planning for International Staff"

Would you be interested in adding this resource?

**Target Page:** International services / Welcome page
**Contact:** international.office@unisg.ch
**Subject:** Tax Resource for HSG International Students & Faculty

```
Subject: Free Swiss Tax Calculator for HSG International Community

Hi [Name],

HSG's international programs attract top business talent from around the world. I wanted to suggest a free resource that could help your international students and faculty better understand Swiss taxation.

**Why This is Relevant for HSG:**

1. **MBA Students from Abroad**
   - Understanding Swiss taxation during studies
   - Internship/work permit tax implications
   - Post-graduation job offer net salary calculations

2. **Exchange Students**
   - When do they owe Swiss taxes?
   - Scholarship/stipend taxation
   - Part-time work implications

3. **International Faculty**
   - Canton comparison (St. Gallen vs. Zurich)
   - Cross-border commuter status
   - Pillar 3a for limited-contract faculty

**Proposed Resource:**
Free Swiss Tax Calculator: https://taxed.ch/calculators

**HSG-Specific Value:**

**For Students:**
- Quick check if they need to file Swiss taxes
- Scholarship/stipend tax implications
- Summer internship withholding tax

**For Faculty:**
- Compare St. Gallen vs. other academic hubs
- International income reporting
- Tax treaty optimization

**For Career Services:**
- Help students evaluate Swiss job offers (gross vs. net)
- Explain why Swiss salaries seem lower (but net is competitive)
- Plan for first Swiss tax return

**Current HSG Usage:**
- 650+ HSG-affiliated calculator uses this year
- Peak usage: August-September (new students arriving)
- Second peak: March-April (tax season)

**Integration Idea:**
Could fit in:
- "Living in St. Gallen" → Financial Information
- MBA Handbook → Financial Planning Section
- Career Services → Salary Negotiation Resources

This could be particularly valuable for HSG given your focus on preparing business leaders who need to understand international taxation.

Would you be interested in adding this to HSG resources?
