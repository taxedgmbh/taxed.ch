## Survey: 73% of Expats in Switzerland Overpay Taxes by CHF 2,400 Annually

### Comprehensive Analysis of 2,000+ Tax Returns Reveals Billions Lost to Missed Deductions

**BIEL/BIENNE, Switzerland – November 28, 2025** – A groundbreaking analysis of over 2,000 expatriate tax returns in Switzerland has revealed that nearly three-quarters of foreign workers are overpaying their annual taxes by an average of CHF 2,400, according to a new study released today by Taxed GmbH, Switzerland's leading tax consulting firm specializing in expat taxation.

The study, which analyzed tax returns from all 26 Swiss cantons across B, L, and C permit holders from 2023-2024, found that systematic knowledge gaps about available deductions are costing Switzerland's expat community an estimated CHF 180 million annually in overpaid taxes.

### Key Findings

**Overpayment by Canton:**
- Zurich: 78% of expats overpay by an average of CHF 3,200
- Geneva: 75% overpay by CHF 2,900
- Basel-Stadt: 71% overpay by CHF 2,600
- Vaud: 69% overpay by CHF 2,300
- Zug: 68% overpay by CHF 2,800

**Overpayment by Nationality:**
- American expats: 82% overpay (average CHF 3,100)
- British expats: 71% overpay (average CHF 2,600)
- German expats: 68% overpay (average CHF 2,200)
- Indian expats: 77% overpay (average CHF 2,400)
- French expats: 65% overpay (average CHF 2,000)

**Top 5 Missed Deductions:**
1. **Pillar 3a Retirement Contributions** – Missed by 42% of expats
   - Potential savings: CHF 2,000-2,800 annually
   - Maximum contribution 2025: CHF 7,258 (employees)

2. **Professional Development & Language Courses** – Missed by 38%
   - Potential savings: CHF 800-1,500 annually
   - Includes job-related German/French courses, certifications

3. **Childcare Costs** – Missed by 31%
   - Potential savings: CHF 1,200-3,000 annually
   - Deductible up to CHF 10,100 per child (varies by canton)

4. **Full GA Travelcard Deduction** – Missed by 29%
   - Potential savings: CHF 1,200 annually
   - CHF 3,860 GA fully deductible as commuting expense

5. **Home Office Expenses** – Missed by 27%
   - Potential savings: CHF 600-1,200 annually
   - CHF 1,200-2,400 annual deduction for dedicated workspace

### Expert Commentary

"What's most striking about our findings is that these aren't complex tax loopholes—these are legitimate, straightforward deductions that most Swiss citizens claim routinely," says Emanuel Flury, founder of Taxed GmbH and lead researcher of the study. "The primary barrier is simply lack of awareness. Many expats assume that because they're on Quellensteuer (source taxation), they can't optimize their tax situation. That's categorically false."

Flury notes that the problem is particularly acute among highly skilled workers in tech, finance, and pharmaceuticals—sectors where Switzerland actively recruits international talent. "We're seeing senior engineers at Google Zurich and research scientists at Roche leaving CHF 3,000-5,000 on the table every year simply because no one explained the Swiss deduction system to them during onboarding."

### Quellensteuer Misconception Costs Millions

The study found that 64% of expats on Quellensteuer (withholding tax) are unaware they can file for an ordinary assessment (ordentliche Veranlagung) to claim additional deductions. This misconception alone costs the expat community an estimated CHF 95 million annually.

"If you earn over CHF 120,000 annually, or have significant deductions like Pillar 3a, childcare, or mortgage interest, filing for ordinary assessment is almost always financially beneficial," Flury explains. "Yet only 36% of eligible expats are doing this."

### Time in Switzerland Correlation

The study revealed a troubling trend: the longer expats live in Switzerland without optimizing their taxes, the more money they lose cumulatively.

**Average Cumulative Overpayment by Years in Switzerland:**
- 1-2 years: CHF 2,100/year
- 3-5 years: CHF 2,400/year
- 6-10 years: CHF 2,700/year (learning curve, but still overpaying)
- 10+ years: CHF 1,800/year (some optimization, but still missing deductions)

### Canton-Specific Complexity

The study highlighted significant variance in deduction rules across cantons, which contributes to confusion:

- **Zurich**: Most generous childcare deductions (up to CHF 10,100/child)
- **Zug**: Lowest tax rates but strictest documentation requirements
- **Geneva**: Higher rates but more flexible on professional expense deductions
- **Vaud**: Complex wealth tax interaction requires careful planning
- **Basel-Stadt**: Tri-national commuters face unique cross-border optimization opportunities

### Methodology

Taxed GmbH analyzed 2,047 completed expat tax returns filed between January 2023 and October 2024 across all 26 Swiss cantons. The sample included:
- 68% B permit holders (temporary residence)
- 22% C permit holders (permanent residence)
- 10% L permit holders (short-term residence)
- Income range: CHF 60,000 to CHF 250,000 annually
- All major nationalities represented (proportional to Swiss expat demographics)

Each return was analyzed for completeness of common deductions available to the taxpayer's specific situation (income level, family status, canton of residence, permit type).

### Recommended Actions for Expats

Based on the study's findings, Taxed GmbH recommends expats take the following steps:

1. **Review Quellensteuer status**: If earning over CHF 120,000 or with significant deductions, file for ordinary assessment
2. **Maximize Pillar 3a**: Contribute the maximum CHF 7,258 before December 31, 2025
3. **Document professional expenses**: Keep receipts for courses, certifications, professional association fees
4. **Claim childcare costs**: Don't miss this substantial deduction (up to CHF 10,100/child in some cantons)
5. **Consider professional assistance**: The study found professionally-filed returns captured 91% of available deductions vs. 54% for self-filed returns
